## Description
This is an assignment that was assigned from the Case Western Bootcamp. I had to build an API for social networking where users would be able to share thoughts amongst one another as well as treat it like a media page where you could friend each other. We use Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB as well as some other dependencies to help out like moment.
